# Test quality round 2

## Summary

Five test files reimplement production logic inline and never execute the real code under test (`docs/rules/testing.md` line 12), plus one route test fires an un-mocked fire-and-forget service (line 11) causing cross-file flakiness. Same class as the merged `tautological-idor-tests` todo (PRs #294/#309), new files.

## Background

Found in the 2026-05-31 code-quality re-run (H1, H2, M7, M8, M9, M10). A test that re-implements the logic it claims to verify gives false CI confidence — the real code can regress with the suite still green.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `client/camera/hooks/__tests__/useCamera.test.ts` (H1) — file has ZERO imports; reimplements `handleBarcodeScanned` inline. Import and exercise the real `useCamera` hook (`useCamera.ts:72-127`), or delete if covered elsewhere
- [ ] `client/context/__tests__/OnboardingContext.test.ts` (H2) — never imports the context; re-declares type/defaults, reimplements `updateData`/`nextStep`/`prevStep`, hardcodes `totalSteps=8`. Exercise the real provider/hook
- [ ] `client/context/__tests__/PremiumContext.test.ts` (M7) — keep the legit `TIER_FEATURES` assertions; replace the reimplemented tier/`isPremium` derivation (lines 11-46) with the real provider value
- [ ] `server/__tests__/routes.test.ts:372-404` (M8) — "Meal Plan Date Range Validation" replicates the route's `validateDateRange`. Extract the real validator from `meal-plan.ts:~371` and test that. (Distinct file from the open `2026-05-31-storage-test-date-range-tautological.md` todo)
- [ ] `client/screens/__tests__/ScanScreenConfirmOverlay-utils.test.ts:191-205` (M9) — `wouldProceed` mirrors the EXPORTED `canLog()` (already imported, line 73 of -utils.ts) and not faithfully (adds a `!!card` guard). Call the real `canLog()`
- [ ] `server/routes/__tests__/chat.test.ts` (M10) — add `vi.mock("../../services/coach-pro-chat")`; the route fires `fireAndForget(tryArchiveNotebook)` (`chat.ts:247-249`) which currently runs the real service post-await, mutating shared mocks → flakiness
- [ ] No net reduction in REAL coverage; all tests pass

## Implementation Notes

- For M8/M9: the proper fix is extract-and-import or call-the-export, NOT reimplement. M8 needs the route to expose the validator (extract it).
- For M10: mirror how sibling route tests mock every fire-and-forget service (see the recipes.test.ts mock factory pattern).

## Risks

- Medium — rewriting tests risks losing coverage signal if done carelessly. For each, confirm real coverage exists (or is added) before deleting a tautological block.

## Updates

### 2026-05-31

- Filed from the 2026-05-31 code-quality re-run, manifest H1, H2, M7, M8, M9, M10.

### 2026-06-01

- Implemented all 6 items. H1/H2/M7 rewritten to exercise the real hook/providers
  via `renderHook` (jsdom + @testing-library/react) per the ThemeContext.test
  template. M8: extracted `validateMealPlanDateRange` (exported from
  `server/routes/meal-plan.ts`, preserving per-branch error-code parity — the
  missing/format branch sends no code) and the route now delegates to it; the
  test imports + calls the real export. M9: replaced the inline `wouldProceed`
  with the real `canLog()`, composing the null guard exactly as ScanScreen.tsx
  (`!!card && canLog(card)`). M10: added an async-factory
  `vi.mock("../../services/coach-pro-chat")` that keeps the real `handleCoachChat`
  (streaming tests for-await over it) and stubs `tryArchiveNotebook`.
- Verified: full suite 5596 passed (379 files), `check:types` clean, lint clean,
  kimi-review (testing,typescript) — no findings.
- Out of scope, surfaced for triage (round 3 candidates): the
  `canScanToday calculation` and `isLoading state` describe blocks in
  `PremiumContext.test.ts` still derive their predicate inline (tautological);
  the `usePremiumContext hook` and `Subscription expiry edge cases` blocks
  likewise re-implement the throw guard / isPremium derivation. Left untouched
  per the todo's named scope (lines 11-46 only).
