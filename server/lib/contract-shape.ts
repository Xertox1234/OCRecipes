/**
 * Heuristic guard against object KEY NAMES that are themselves user data rather than a
 * static schema field name a developer hand-typed (see the "never raw values" CAVEAT
 * on `deriveShape` below). This is not a hypothetical future-route backstop: at least
 * two routes in this codebase already return exactly this pattern —
 * `server/routes/grocery.ts` (`allergenFlags` keyed by grocery-item name) and
 * `server/services/menu-analysis.ts` (`allergenFlags` keyed by menu-item name), both
 * flagging which specific foods trigger a user's allergies. Free-text item names like
 * "shrimp" match none of the DYNAMIC_KEY_PATTERNS below and a shopping/menu list
 * rarely crosses MAX_STATIC_OBJECT_KEYS, so `looksDynamicallyKeyed` alone does not
 * catch them — see `hasUniformNonPrimitiveValueShape` below, the second, independent
 * signal added specifically to close that gap. This function deliberately trades some
 * false positives/negatives for never requiring per-route configuration (an allowlist
 * of expected keys per route pattern was considered and rejected: `deriveShape` itself
 * is a pure function with no route context, and while its sole caller —
 * `recordSnapshot` in server/lib/contract-snapshot.ts — does have route context
 * available, wiring a per-route allowlist through that one call site would still make
 * the allowlist a second, drift-prone place to update on every response shape change
 * across the ~45 route modules in this app, a maintenance cost judged not worth
 * trading for the heuristic's occasional over/under-redaction).
 *
 *   - MAX_STATIC_OBJECT_KEYS (50): a real static schema (deliberately named fields)
 *     essentially never has this many keys at one nesting level; a genuine dynamic-key
 *     leak (one entry per user/row) typically has far more. Kept generous so a
 *     legitimately large-but-static object (a wide settings/feature-flag bag) is NOT
 *     over-redacted, since over-redaction silently degrades the diff tool's
 *     field-level usefulness for that route.
 *   - DYNAMIC_KEY_PATTERNS: keys that look like an email, a UUID, or a long numeric id
 *     are values an application developer would essentially never choose as a
 *     hand-typed field name. Any key longer than MAX_KEY_LENGTH_FOR_PATTERN_CHECK
 *     skips straight to "dynamic" without running the patterns at all — both a cheap
 *     defense against pathological input on the request-handling path (`deriveShape`
 *     runs inline before the DB write, per server/lib/contract-snapshot.ts) and a
 *     reasonable prior, since no real static field name approaches that length.
 *   - FALSE NEGATIVE (closed for the two known routes via a producer marker, see
 *     `deriveForcedDynamicShape` below — residual only for an unmarked route): a
 *     dynamic-keyed object with fewer than MIN_UNIFORM_MAP_KEYS entries whose key(s)
 *     also don't match a DYNAMIC_KEY_PATTERN (e.g. a response with exactly one
 *     flagged allergen item) is not caught by either heuristic signal alone — this
 *     is COMMON, not a rare edge case: a user with exactly one matching allergen on a
 *     grocery/menu list is an ordinary real-world scenario for
 *     server/routes/grocery.ts and server/services/menu-analysis.ts, not a corner
 *     case. Both routes call `markDynamicKeyFields` (server/lib/dynamic-key-fields.ts)
 *     to force-redact `allergenFlags` deterministically regardless of entry count, so
 *     this gap is closed for them; a future, not-yet-marked route with the same
 *     free-text-keyed shape would still fall through to this heuristic alone.
 *
 *     NOT INSTRUMENTED (deliberate decision, not an oversight): unlike the
 *     all-primitive-valued gap below (see `hasUnredactedUniformPrimitiveObject`),
 *     this sub-2-entry gap has no runtime telemetry, because a single- or
 *     zero-key object is the single most common object shape in any JSON API — an
 *     `{ id }`, a `{ status: "ok" }`, an empty `{}` — so a signal here would fire on
 *     an overwhelming majority of ordinary responses with near-zero
 *     signal-to-noise, unlike the >= 2-key uniform-primitive check, which is
 *     comparatively rare. A marker- or count-based signal restricted to *known*
 *     dynamic-key-producing fields would need the same per-route bookkeeping
 *     `markDynamicKeyFields` already provides, so it would add nothing this gap
 *     doesn't already have covered for the two known routes.

 * Second, independent dynamic-key signal: an object whose values ALL derive to the

 * actually catches `allergenFlags`-style objects (see `looksDynamicallyKeyed` above),
 * since their key names are ordinary free text. `mergeShapes` only collapses to a
 * single non-`mixed` shape when every value is BYTE-IDENTICAL in structure (same
 * nested key names and types), so two legitimately different static object fields
 * (e.g. `user: {...}` and `address: {...}` with different internal keys) will
 * usually NOT trigger this — only genuine "N records, all the same shape" data does.
 * CAVEAT: this is structural, not semantic — two coincidentally same-shaped but
 * unrelated static fields (e.g. `tags: string[]` and `categories: string[]`, or two
 * static object fields that happen to share identical nested keys) ALSO collapse to
 * `<dynamic>`. That's an intentional over-redaction / false-positive tradeoff, not a
 * bug: it costs the diff tool some field-level granularity on that route, but never
 * causes a leak (see `contract-shape.test.ts`'s "DOES redact two static array-typed
 * fields..." test for a pinned example).
 *
 * FALSE NEGATIVE (closed for the two known routes via a producer marker, distinct
 * from the single-entry gap above): a dynamic-keyed object whose
 * values are all PRIMITIVE (e.g. `{ shrimp: "high", peanuts: "severe" }` — a
 * plausible simplification of `allergenFlags` from `Record<string, {allergenId,
 * severity}>` to `Record<string, AllergySeverity>`) is caught by NEITHER heuristic
 * signal for object sizes in the 2-50 entry range — bounded above by
 * MAX_STATIC_OBJECT_KEYS (the 1-entry case is the separately documented
 * single-entry gap above, not this signal's doing), not unbounded at any entry
 * count: past 50 entries, `looksDynamicallyKeyed`'s key-count check fires
 * independently of value type, so a larger all-primitive-valued object is still
 * redacted by that signal alone. Primitives are deliberately excluded from
 * `hasUniformNonPrimitiveValueShape` precisely because they collide too often in
 * legitimate static records (`{ width: 100, height: 50 }`, `{ r, g, b }`) to use as a
 * uniformity signal. Not live in this
 * codebase today (no `Record<string, primitive>` response-shaped value exists as of
 * this writing), but a future refactor to that shape at `allergenFlags` would still
 * be caught, since `deriveForcedDynamicShape` below redacts a marked field's value
 * regardless of whether its entries are primitive or non-primitive — only a
 * not-yet-marked route reintroducing this shape elsewhere remains exposed.
 *
 * Requires >= MIN_UNIFORM_MAP_KEYS entries: a single key trivially "matches itself,"
 * so a 1-entry check would redact virtually every nested single-field object in the
 * app. A dynamic-keyed map with exactly one live entry is not caught by this signal
 * (documented residual risk, same class noted in `looksDynamicallyKeyed` above).
 *
 * Takes the already-merged shape rather than computing it internally — the caller
 * (deriveShape) needs `mergeShapes(valueShapes)` either way when the object turns out
 * dynamic (as the `<dynamic>` placeholder's value shape), so it merges once and passes
 * the result in here rather than merging twice for the same input.

 * all the SAME primitive type. This is the mirror image of
 * `hasUniformNonPrimitiveValueShape` -- that function deliberately excludes
 * primitive values from the redaction decision (see its doc comment); this
 * function walks the shape `deriveShape` already returned to flag the same
 * structural pattern for a caller to log, purely for manual triage. It never
 * changes what `deriveShape` returns and is not itself a redaction signal --
 * `deriveShape` stays pure/side-effect-free; see `recordSnapshot` in
 * contract-snapshot.ts for the one caller that logs on a hit.
 *
 * A correctly-redacted `<dynamic>` placeholder node (exactly one key,
 * DYNAMIC_KEY_PLACEHOLDER) is never itself flagged -- it fails the
 * >= MIN_UNIFORM_MAP_KEYS check on its own single key. But this function does NOT
 * merely skip that one key; it also does not recurse into the placeholder's merged
 * value shape (see the `<dynamic>` short-circuit in the object case below). That
 * pruning is deliberate, not incidental: for a real dynamic map like
 * `allergenFlags` (redacted keys, values shaped `{ allergenId: string, severity:
 * string }`), the per-entry value shape is ITSELF a 2-key, same-typed-string
 * object that would otherwise match this exact proxy signal on virtually every
 * response with >= 1 flagged allergen -- a false trigger on the two live routes
 * the whole redaction mechanism exists to protect, with zero leak-detection value,
 * since the placeholder's own (sensitive) keys are already hidden and the nested
 * field names are ordinary, already-classified static schema names. Verified
 * empirically against the real grocery.ts/menu.ts allergenFlags shape (see
 * contract-shape.test.ts's redacted-`<dynamic>`-object test).
 *
 * Bounded like `deriveShape`'s own recursion (see `unwrapToKeys` above for the
 * project's convention of documenting this): each call recurses strictly into a
 * child Shape node one level down (an object's values, an array's element shape,
 * or a mixed shape's variants), and `deriveShape` never produces a self-referential
 * Shape, so this always terminates at the tree's leaves. Same complexity class as
 * `deriveShape` itself -- O(distinct shape nodes), not O(payload), since
 * `mergeShapes` already collapsed any repeated structure before this ever runs.
 *
 * SIGNAL-TO-NOISE ASSESSMENT (the concern raised in this feature's own todo Risks
 * section): even with the `<dynamic>`-subtree pruning above, this still fires on
 * the identical structural pattern for two cases that are NOT distinguishable from
 * a plain (non-redacted) object's shape alone -- (a) a genuine primitive-valued
 * dynamic map (e.g. a hypothetical `Record<string, AllergySeverity>` simplification
 * of `allergenFlags`, the gap this proxies for), and (b) an entirely ordinary
 * static object that happens to have >= 2 same-typed fields, e.g. `{ width: 100,
 * height: 50 }` or `{ r: 255, g: 0, b: 0 }` -- ordinary, common, and completely
 * benign. Case (b) will fire far more often than case (a) in most route surfaces.
 * Accepted deliberately rather than solved: requiring the *same* primitive type
 * across all keys (not just "all primitive") already prunes the more common
 * heterogeneous case (`{ id: 5, name: "a" }` does NOT match); going further (e.g.
 * key-name heuristics to guess "static" vs "dynamic" intent) would be inventing a
 * new redaction-adjacent heuristic, which this feature's own acceptance criteria
 * explicitly rule out ("cheap, single-condition check, no new heuristic"). This is
 * why the caller logs at `debug`, not `warn`: a noisy-but-cheap breadcrumb for
 * someone manually inspecting `dev.contract_snapshots` rows for a suspected leak,
 * not an actionable alert.
