# Two-Level Unsaved-Changes Prompt Fires Twice

## Problem

`WizardShell` (child component) had a discard-changes Alert in its `goBack` handler for step 1. `RecipeCreateScreen` (parent) also had a `beforeRemove` listener showing an identical Alert when `isDirtyRef.current === true`. Tapping the in-wizard Back button on step 1 fired both prompts in sequence: WizardShell's Alert, then on "Discard" the navigation triggered `beforeRemove`, which showed the second identical Alert. The user had to tap "Discard" twice to actually exit.

## Symptoms

- Two identical "Discard changes?" dialogs in a row
- Only happens on the wizard's in-screen Back button — hardware back / swipe / tab switch fire only once
- Both code paths exist; both produce the same user-visible UI

## Root Cause

Two code paths both observed "user is trying to exit with unsaved changes" and both implemented the prompt. The `beforeRemove` listener is the correct owner because it intercepts ALL exit paths — hardware back button, swipe-back gesture, tab switch, deep-link replace — not just the explicit in-wizard Back button. The child's prompt is redundant on the back-button path and absent on every other path.

## Solution

Remove the child's prompt entirely. The child just calls `onGoBack()` (or `navigation.goBack()`) and lets the parent's `beforeRemove` listener decide whether to prompt:

```typescript
// Wrong: child duplicates the prompt
if (currentStep === 1 && form.isDirty) {
  Alert.alert("Discard?", ..., [{ text: "Discard", onPress: onGoBack }]);
  return;
}
onGoBack();

// Right: child delegates; screen's beforeRemove is the sole owner
if (currentStep === 1) {
  onGoBack(); // beforeRemove will intercept if form is dirty
  return;
}
```

## Prevention

- When a screen uses `beforeRemove` to prompt for unsaved changes, child components must NOT duplicate the prompt.
- Single owner principle: exactly one component (the screen with `beforeRemove`) decides whether to prompt. Everyone else just triggers navigation.
- Audit any "Discard?" `Alert.alert` calls inside nested components — they are almost always wrong if the parent screen has a `beforeRemove`.
