# jsdom RN render tests cannot assert a11y-tree hiding OR grouping — assert label absence/uniqueness and exact full-label composition instead

## Rule

In jsdom render tests, never write (or name) a test as verifying that `accessible={false}` removes an element from the accessibility tree, or that `accessible={true}` collapses a subtree into one VoiceOver/TalkBack-announced node — the harness cannot model either direction of this prop. Instead:

1. Assert **label absence** (`queryByLabelText(...)` is null) to guard against a decorative child re-acquiring its own `accessibilityLabel` (the `accessible={false}`/hiding case).
2. Assert **label uniqueness plus no nested label** for a grouping wrapper (`accessible={true}`): `getByLabelText`/`findByLabelText` throws if the composed label resolves to more than one element, so a single successful match already proves there's no duplicate; then assert the wrapper's icon/text children carry no independent `aria-label` of their own (e.g. `wrapper.querySelector("[aria-label]")` is `null`) — this is the closest verifiable proxy to "children don't have separate accessible identities," short of the real subtree-collapse the harness can't model.
3. Assert composed `accessibilityLabel` strings with **exact full-string matches, one per input combination** — never a start-anchored regex, which silently stops pinning the tail's spacing/punctuation.
4. Name the test for what it proves (e.g. "does not carry a redundant label", "exposes exactly one accessible node with the composed label"), and leave on-device VoiceOver/TalkBack verification to the emulator-logcat procedure.

## Why

`test/mocks/react-native.ts`'s `mockComponent` helper does not destructure `accessible`, so the prop spreads onto the DOM `div` as a raw attribute instead of translating to real react-native-web behavior — `aria-hidden="true"` for `accessible={false}` (the `Received \`false\` for a non-boolean attribute \`accessible\`` console warning is this harness gap surfacing), or a collapsed single accessible node for `accessible={true}`. `queryByLabelText` returning null therefore proves only that the label prop is gone — the same assertion passes whether or not `accessible={false}` exists. Both the code-reviewer and mobile-reviewer independently flagged an overclaiming test name for this in the CarouselRecipeCard remix-badge a11y fix review.

The `accessible={true}` side of the same gap surfaced a second time in the confirm-card safety-flag badge (`client/screens/ScanScreen.tsx`), mirroring the ProductChip precedent (commit `8892c990`): the badge sets `accessible={true}` so VoiceOver reads one composed label instead of drilling into its `Feather` icon + `ThemedText` children, but a regression that removed `accessible={true}` from the production `View` would not fail any jsdom assertion, because the mock never models the collapse either direction. The mitigating pattern is the same as the hiding case — assert what's verifiable (uniqueness of the composed-label match, absence of a nested independent label) and be explicit in the test's name/comment that this does not prove the real collapse mechanism.

The exact-match rule exists because a prefix regex like `/^Remixed recipe\. Pasta/` accepts a label whose tail has broken spacing, a dropped segment, or is deleted outright — a template-literal regression after the anchored prefix passes CI silently.

## Examples

- `client/components/home/__tests__/CarouselRecipeCard.test.tsx` — exact full-label assertions across all 4 `isRemix` × `prepTimeMinutes` combinations, plus a label-absence guard whose comment states the harness limitation explicitly (the `accessible={false}`/hiding case).
- `client/screens/__tests__/ScanScreen.test.tsx` (`describe("ScanScreen — confirm-card safety badge (returnAfterLog)")`, `"exposes exactly one accessible node with the composed title+detail label"`) — the `accessible={true}`/grouping case: a single `findByLabelText` match on the composed label plus `badge.querySelector("[aria-label]")` being `null`, with a comment stating the same limitation.

## Exceptions

- A partial/regex match is fine for labels containing genuinely dynamic data the test does not control (timestamps, ids) — pin everything static around it.
- If a11y-tree-hiding or -grouping assertions become a recurring need, the durable fix is teaching `mockComponent` to map `accessible === false` → `aria-hidden="true"` and `accessible === true` (with descendant labels) → collapse to a single labelled node; until then the mock's pass-through is pre-existing, accepted behavior.
