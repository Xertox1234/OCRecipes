# Harness Residuals — known gaps, frozen

**Ruling (user, 2026-09-22):** guard/hook hardening is **frozen**. The command guards in
`.claude/hooks/` exist to stop an agent from _accidentally_ running an outward-facing command
(the 2026-08-16 OTA incident). They are not, and cannot be, a complete parser of adversarial
shell. Each fix closed one family and review found the next one, so the backlog kept growing.
In September, 35 of 45 archived todos were harness work, and 15 of the 18 open harness todos
had come out of reviewing an earlier harness PR.

So a **constructible** bypass or over-denial in a guard is recorded here, **not** filed as a
todo. Reopen an entry only when it has actually been hit in real use (an accidental command got
through, or real work was blocked). Promote it then by moving its archived todo back into
`todos/`.

Review findings against `.claude/hooks/**` go to this list (see `docs/AI_WORKFLOW.md` →
Review Policy → One review pass per PR).

## Still open as todos (not frozen, they cost time on every PR)

- `todos/P1-2026-09-22-outward-cli-corpus-runs-17-to-27-minutes-…`: the corpus run takes 17–27
  minutes on every push.
- `todos/P2-2026-09-20-todo-executor-commits-after-review-…`: forces a confirmation review on
  every `/todo` PR.

### Over-denial and friction (the guard blocks legitimate work)

Workaround for all three: commit messages and PR bodies go through the Write tool + `-F`.
